## Overview

**FitLook** is designed for fashion lovers and shoppers who want to simplify the process of choosing the right outfit for the right occasion.

It consists of three major modules:

-  **Backend API** ‚Äì Built with Java Spring Boot for managing user data, outfit suggestions, and storing images.
-  **AI Module** ‚Äì Built with Python and LangChain using Gemini Pro Vision for deep outfit analysis and image-based recommendations.
-  **Frontend App** ‚Äì Built with React Native for a smooth mobile experience.

## How It Works

1. **User uploads an outfit photo in the mobile app**
2. **Frontend sends the image to the Python AI module**
3. **LangChain+Gemini analyzes the outfit and generates suggestions**
4. **Backend stores and serves suggestion data**
5. **Frontend shows the results and allows further actions (shopping links, virtual try-on, etc.)**
